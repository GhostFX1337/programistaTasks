Explanation:

To create the program in question we have to set several variables:

- one for the number of days, it should be a number

- one for the number of leaves (it must be an array of numbers)

- one to successfully check if the leaves of each plant is within the established range

- one for the end output result

First I use a loop which goes through the entire plants array and checks if each number is within 0 and 10000.
If this condition is met the params variable should be equal to true (boolean check).

Next I make a separate loop nested within an if statement which includes the other two requiremens:

- days must be between 1 and 100 

- the total number of plants must be between 1 and 10

The loop will repeat itself once for each day of harvest

Next, we create an internal variable valid only within the scope of the loop theMostFruitfulPlant which will
be equal to the largest number within the plants array devided by two and rounded down as specified.

We then add this to the end result output variable.

Next we need to create a new variable largestNumberIndex which will show us the index position of the largest number at that time before we increment 2 leaves to each plant. 

Once this is done we subtract the value of theMostFruitfulPlant from the largestNumberIndex variable as we have taken leaves away from the plant.

Lastly, we use a nested loop which goes through the entire plants array and increments 2 leaves to each plant.

I added two checks which will show an error in case the days are not within the allowed range or the leaves are not within the allowed range.
